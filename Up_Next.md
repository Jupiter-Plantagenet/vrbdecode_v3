# Up Next

This is the remaining work before the project and paper can be considered submission-ready.

## Implementation
- Add a succinct SNARK wrapper (Groth16/Plonk) around the final Nova proof, with an EVM verifier contract and a demo verification path.
- Implement the commitment/DA layer for candidate sets and receipts (on-chain commitment to cand_hash and h_T, off-chain storage and lookup).
- Produce and persist wrapped proof artifacts (proof bytes, public inputs) in a stable output location for reuse.
- Add an end-to-end pipeline script that generates: Nova proof -> wrapped SNARK proof -> EVM verifier inputs.

## Evaluation artifacts
- Generate and store the missing figure PDFs referenced by the paper (system_architecture.pdf, decoding_pipeline.pdf, constraints_vs_k.pdf, nova_avg_step_time_vs_n.pdf, nova_peak_rss_vs_n.pdf) in paper/ict_express/figures.
- Run a minimal wrapper experiment and record: wrapped proof size, wrap time, on-chain verify time/gas.
- Add a baseline comparison that is not cherry-picked:
  - Per-step proofs without folding vs folded + wrapped proof.
  - Unwrapped Nova proof size/verify vs wrapped proof size/verify.
  - Optional ablation: naive O(K^2) sorting constraints vs optimized sorting constraints.

## Paper updates
- Update the paper to mark the SNARK wrapper and commitment/DA layer as implemented (not future work).
- Add a short, explicit novelty paragraph that isolates the decoding-layer contribution vs zkML forward-pass proofs.
- Add a paragraph on the baseline comparison and include a small table or short subsection with results.
- Confirm that claims in the abstract and results section match stored artifacts and tables.

## Submission readiness checklist
- Ensure all plots/tables are reproducible and generated by scripts in the repo.
- Confirm all referenced assets exist in the repo and compile cleanly in Overleaf.
- Verify references and citation formatting for ICT Express.
- Freeze the evaluation environment details (hardware, software versions) in the paper and/or appendix.
